1. How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test(1,2,3)?

   I only got solutions in fewer than 20 guesses 2 times. The theory that found the solution in less than 20 guesses was theory 3.
   I dont think it changes that much based on the theory, and is mostly based on luck. 

2. What is good or bad about this strategy?

   The bad thing about the RandomClue strategy is that it does not eliminate the incorrect murderers, locations, or weapons when it checks 
   with Assistant Jack. That means that it will use the incorrect murderers, locations, and weapons multiple times.
